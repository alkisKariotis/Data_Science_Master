# --------- TEAM ---------

Kariotis Alkiviadis: 50%
Konti Myrto: 50%


Alkiviadis and Myrto collaborated closely throughout the duration of the project, 
leveraging their individual strengths to ensure its successful completion at an optimal level. 
Each team member took ownership of specific aspects of the application while also contributing collaboratively to shared tasks.

Alkiviadis primarily focused on the implementation of critical components such as the Spark Streaming application (mine.py) 
responsible for processing transactions and mining blocks. He dedicated significant effort to optimizing the mining process, 
experimenting with different parallelization techniques to improve performance. 
He also played a crucial role in setting up and configuring the Kafka environment for streaming block data, 
ensuring seamless integration between Spark and Kafka components. During this setup, Myrto provided valuable assistance, 
aiding in configuring the server environment, ensuring compatibility with Spark, and troubleshooting any issues that arose. 
Together, we established a robust Kafka infrastructure to support the project's requirements. 

Myrto took responsibility for designing and implementing the MongoDB component of the solution, 
ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of block information for subsequent processing and queries. 
She spent considerable time fine-tuning the MongoDB database setup and optimizing query performance 
to handle the blockchain data effectively. She also collaborated closely with Alkiviadis 
on integrating MongoDB with the Kafka pipeline, ensuring smooth data flow across the system. 
In addition to her technical contributions, Myrto also took the lead in querying MongoDB, to check the data pipeline and
retrieve results, ensuring process validity and ease of understanding of the process. 

Both team members regularly communicated through four meetings, each lasting 4-5 hours, to develop the application, 
share insights, and provide feedback to each other to maintain alignment and ensure consistency across 
different components of the applications.  
The team performed two presentation rehearsals, each lasting 20 minutes, to refine their project presentation, 
ensure coherence, and prepare for any potential questions.

In summary, Alkiviadis and Myrto worked collaboratively and efficiently, with each member taking ownership of specific tasks 
while also contributing to shared goals. Their combined efforts resulted in the successful development of a robust blockchain 
analytics solution leveraging Spark, Kafka, and MongoDB technologies.
