Hello, my name's John and I'm a student. I've been studying computer science for three years now. I'd like to specialize in artificial intelligence. It's a field that fascinates me.

I can't imagine doing anything else. I won't let anything stand in my way. However, studying isn't always easy. There're many challenges along the way. But I'll overcome them.

I've got a good group of friends. They're also studying computer science. They've been a great support. We often study together. It's more fun that way.

One day, we'd like to start our own tech company. That's our dream. We're working hard to make it a reality. We know it won't be easy, but we're ready for the challenge.

I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had. I know I've got a bright future ahead of me. I'm looking forward to it.

Money isn't everything, but it's definitely important. I'd like to make a good living. But more than that, I want to do something I love. That's the most important thing.
